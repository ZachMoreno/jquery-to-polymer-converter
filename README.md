# jQuery Plugin to Polymer Custom Element Converter

### There is no code in this repo yet. It is only meant for brainstorming, & ideas are most welcome. Send me an issue, pull request or an email at xachmoreno@gmail.com.

## Ideas
 - Drag & drop Web interface for taking zipped up jQuery plugins as input
 - Use either the UglifyJS or JSLint parsers to analyze the plugin
 - Create a JSON file based on the results of the parser to identify traits in DOM structure, classes, bindings, etc.
 - Run node, npm, and yeoman on the server to generate a polymer custom element based on the created JSON
 - Author signs in with GitHub OAuth & will be given the option to either
 1. create a new repo under their account to store the generated custom element
 2. download it as a zip folder
